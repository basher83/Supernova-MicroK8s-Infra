# Task Management System Documentation

## Overview

This task management system provides structured tracking for the MicroK8s infrastructure deployment on Proxmox. It ensures clear visibility of work items, dependencies, and progress across the infrastructure pipeline (Terraform, Ansible, Deployment).

## Purpose

The task system addresses several critical needs:

- **Visibility**: Clear understanding of what needs to be done and current progress
- **Dependencies**: Explicit tracking of task relationships and blockers
- **Prioritization**: P0/P1/P2 classification for resource allocation
- **Validation**: Success criteria and validation steps for each task
- **Documentation**: Detailed implementation guidance for complex tasks

```

## How to Use This System

### 1. Check Current Status

Review `INDEX.md` for:

- Overall project progress percentage
- Current phase and priorities
- Task dependencies and blockers
- Critical path for completion

### 2. Select a Task

Choose tasks marked as 🔄 Ready that match your expertise:

- **TER** tasks: Terraform modules and infrastructure provisioning
- **ANS** tasks: Ansible roles and MicroK8s configuration
- **DEP** tasks: Deployment pipeline and validation

### 3. Follow Task Structure

Each task file contains:

- Clear objective and success criteria
- Step-by-step implementation guide
- Validation commands
- Dependencies and prerequisites

## Task File Format

All task files follow the structure defined in [`template.md`](template.md).

See the template file for the exact format and all required sections.

## Status Indicators

- 🔄 **Ready**: Task can be started immediately
- ⏸️ **Blocked**: Waiting on dependencies to complete
- 🚧 **In Progress**: Currently being worked on
- ✅ **Complete**: Task finished and validated
- ❌ **Failed**: Task encountered issues, needs revision

## Priority Levels

- **P0 (Critical)**: Must complete for pipeline to function
- **P1 (Important)**: Significant functionality or improvement
- **P2 (Nice to Have)**: Optimization or enhancement

## Task Categories

### Terraform Setup (TER)

Tasks related to infrastructure provisioning:

- MicroK8s VM module creation
- Vendor data configuration
- Environment-specific setups
- Network and storage configuration

### Ansible Configuration (ANS)

Tasks for MicroK8s cluster configuration:

- Role development for MicroK8s
- HA cluster formation
- Addon deployment (Rancher, ArgoCD)
- Testing and validation

### Deployment Pipeline (DEP)

Tasks for automation and validation:

- Deployment script creation
- Integration testing
- Cluster validation
- Monitoring setup

## Creating New Tasks

### 1. Determine Task Category

- **TER**: Terraform modules and infrastructure
- **ANS**: Ansible roles and MicroK8s configuration
- **DEP**: Deployment pipeline and validation
- Add new categories as needed

### 2. Assign Task ID

Use sequential numbering:

- TER-001, TER-002, etc.
- ANS-001, ANS-002, etc.
- DEP-001, DEP-002, etc.

### 3. Use the Template

Copy `template.md` and fill in all sections:

- Keep descriptions concise and actionable
- Include specific commands and file paths
- Define clear success criteria
- **IMPORTANT**: Run `date +"%Y-%m-%d"` to get current date for Created/Updated fields
- Update the "Updated" field whenever status changes

### 4. Update INDEX.md

Add your task to the appropriate phase table and update:

- Task counts and time estimates
- Dependency graph if needed
- Overall completion percentage

## Best Practices

### Task Sizing

- **Small** (1-2 hours): Single file changes, simple configurations
- **Medium** (3-4 hours): Multi-file changes, new features
- **Large** (5+ hours): Consider breaking into subtasks

### Dependencies

- List explicit task IDs that must complete first
- Use "None" for tasks that can start immediately
- Update blocked tasks when dependencies complete

### Validation

- Include specific commands to verify success
- Reference test files or playbooks
- Document expected output

### Documentation

- Link to relevant ADRs and guides
- Reference external documentation
- Include troubleshooting tips

## Workflow Example

```bash
# 1. Check current status
cat tasks/INDEX.md | grep "Ready"

# 2. Select a task
cat tasks/terraform-setup/TER-001-*.md

# 3. Complete the work
cd infrastructure-microk8s/modules
terraform init && terraform plan

# 4. Validate completion
terraform validate
terraform fmt -check

# 5. Update task status in INDEX.md
# Change status from 🔄 Ready to ✅ Complete
```

## Integration Points

This task system integrates with:

- **[Planning Document](../docs/planning.md)**: Detailed integration strategy
- **[Blueprint](../docs/blueprint.md)**: MicroK8s deployment architecture
- **[PRD](../docs/PRD.md)**: Product requirements and specifications
- **[Infrastructure Code](../infrastructure/)**: Existing Terraform patterns
- **[Ansible Playbooks](../ansible/)**: Configuration management

## Maintenance

- Review task status weekly
- Archive completed phases to `completed/` subdirectory
- Update time estimates based on actual completion
- Add lessons learned to task notes
